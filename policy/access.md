# GitHub Access Management Policy

## Teams, not individuals

Access to repositories will be granted via [GitHub teams](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams#team-visibility) and not to individuals. 

A repo may have any number of teams added to it to ensure apropriate levels of access.

## Team structure

Teams will be nested and aligned with the GMG Working Group hierarchy. The most deeply nested team should be the one with the highest privileges (i.e., maintain/admin).

### Top level teams

- [Staff](https://github.com/orgs/gmggroup/teams/staff) - GMG staff members
- [Working Groups](https://github.com/orgs/gmggroup/teams/working-groups) - contains subteams aligned with top level Working Groups and must start with `wg-`
- [Project Committees](https://github.com/orgs/gmggroup/teams/project-committees) - must start with `pc-
- [Projects](https://github.com/orgs/gmggroup/teams/projects) - must start with `repo-`  

## GitHub organisation membership

 Membership to the [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/orgs/gmggroup/people) is not limited to paid GMG members and the wider community is welcome to join and participate. Removal from the org will only be made on advice of the GMG Executive Committee.

 Note: organisation membership is required for team membership that grants specific permissions to repos

## Principle of least privilege

[Permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/repository-roles-for-an-organization) granted should only be as high as necessary to perform a certain role/function.

- Maintain access shall be granted on a per-repo basis using the associated team and limited to current GMG members. Exceptions to the GMG membership requirement may be made by the Working Group Steering Committee in conjunction with the GMG Executive
